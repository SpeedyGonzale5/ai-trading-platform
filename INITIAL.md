# Trading Dashboard Feature Request

## FEATURE:
Build a comprehensive crypto trading dashboard that displays real-time portfolio performance, market data, and trading interface. The dashboard should include:

- Real-time portfolio value and 24h change display
- Interactive portfolio allocation donut chart using Chart.js
- Token holdings table with sortable columns
- Quick trade buttons for each token
- Price alerts management section
- Recent transactions feed
- Market sentiment indicators

The dashboard should update in real-time via WebSocket connections and handle graceful degradation when connections fail. All data should be cached locally for offline viewing.

## EXAMPLES:
Use these examples as implementation patterns:

- `examples/components/Portfolio.js` - Follow the component structure and state management patterns
- `examples/hooks/useWebSocket.js` - Use for real-time data connections
- `examples/hooks/usePortfolio.js` - Follow portfolio data management patterns
- `examples/services/api.js` - Use established API calling patterns
- `examples/utils/formatters.js` - Use consistent number and currency formatting

## DOCUMENTATION:
- Chart.js documentation: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/
- CoinGecko API: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
- WebSocket API for real-time prices: https://docs.binance.us/#websocket-streams
- React documentation: https://react.dev/

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
-Use environment variables for API key configuration instead of hardcoded model strings
- Implement proper loading states for all data fetching
- Handle WebSocket reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Cache portfolio data in localStorage for offline access
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with collapsible sections
- Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Performance: Virtualize token holdings table if >100 tokens
- Security: Validate all incoming WebSocket data
- Accessibility: Include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
